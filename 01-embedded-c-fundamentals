# Embedded C Fundamentals

This module focuses on core Embedded C concepts that are frequently
tested in firmware and embedded systems interviews.

## Topics Covered
- C data types and memory sizes
- Pointer fundamentals and common pitfalls
- const, volatile, and static keywords
- Structures, unions, and bit-fields
- Memory layout: stack, heap, BSS, data
- Function pointers and callbacks
- Undefined and implementation-defined behavior

## Why This Matters in Interviews
Interviewers expect candidates to understand how C code maps to
memory and hardware. This module emphasizes **reasoning**, not memorization.

## Sample Interview Questions
- Why is `volatile` mandatory for hardware registers?
- Difference between `const int *p` and `int *const p`?
- What happens when stack overflows in embedded systems?
- Why is dynamic memory risky in firmware?

## Toolchain / Platform
- Compiler: GCC (arm-none-eabi-gcc)
- Architecture: ARM Cortex-M (conceptual + examples)
